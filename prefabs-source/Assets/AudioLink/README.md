# Udon AudioLink

## A repository of audio reactive prefabs for VRChat, written in UdonSharp

AudioLink is a system that analyzes and processes in-world audio into many different highly reactive data streams and exposes the data to VRChat Udon, world shaders, and avatar shaders. 

The per-frequency audio amplitude data is first read briefly into Udon using Unity's GetOutputData. It is then sent to the GPU for signal processing and buffered into a CustomRenderTexture. Then, the CustomRenderTexture is broadcast globally (called `_AudioTexture`) which can be picked up by shaders both in-world and across all avatars.

## 0.2.6 - October 6th, 2021
### New features (big thanks to @cnlohr and @pema99)
- Chronotensity feature provides timing information to shaders which changes in reaction to audio
- ColorChord index colors, a new way to get audio reactive colors from ColorChord
- Globally configurable theme colors
- Filtered VU, smoothly filtered versions of VU data
- Amplify nodes and example shaders for above features
- Added `AudioLinkGetAmplitudeAtFrequency` and `AudioLinkGetAmplitudeAtNote` functions for easily sampling specific parts of the audio spectrum corresponding to certain frequencies or semitones
### Changes
- UnU sliders (thanks Texelsaur)
- Various improvements to included video player, now with a resync button (thanks again, Texelsaur)
- Recursive / nesting support for AudioReactiveSurfaceArray prefab
### Bugfixes
- Fixed certain parts of filtered 4band data always being zero (thanks DomNomNom)

## Updating from version 2.5 or lower? (...first time setup? please see next section)
1. Take note of which AudioSource you are using to feed AudioLink, this reference may be lost during upgrade.
2. Install the latest VRChat SDK3 and UdonSharp (following their directions)
3. Close unity
4. With Windows explorer (NOT within Unity), remove the following files & folders:
   - AudioLink (folder)
   - AudioLink.meta
5. Reopen unity
6. Download and install the [latest AudioLink release](https://github.com/llealloo/vrc-udon-audio-link/releases/latest)
7. In scene(s) containing old versions of AudioLink:
   1. Delete both AudioLink and AudioLinkController prefabs from the scene
   2. Re-add AudioLink and AudioLinkController to the scene by dragging the prefabs from the AudioLink folder in projects *(world creators only)*
   3. Click the "Link all sound reactive objects to this AudioLink" button on AudioLink inspector panel *(world creators only)*
   4. Drag the AudioSource you were using previously into the AudioLink audio source parameter
      - NOTE: If you previously used AudioLinkInput, you are welcome to continue doing so, however now in 2.5+ AudioLink is much smarter about inputs. Try dragging it straight into the AudioLink / audio source parameter!
7. If using AudioReactiveObject or AudioReactiveLight components, you will need to manually re-enable the "Audio Data" under AudioLink "experimental" settings. This feature is now considered experimental until VRChat *maybe* gives us native asynchronous readback.

## First time setup

### Requirements
- [VRChat SDK3](https://vrchat.com/home/download) for worlds (Udon)
- [UdonSharp](https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp/releases/latest)
- [CyanEmu](https://github.com/CyanLaser/CyanEmu/releases/latest) (optional but highly recommended)
- The latest release: https://github.com/llealloo/vrc-udon-audio-link/releases/latest

### Installation
1. Install VRChat SDK3, UdonSharp, CyanEmu, and the latest release of AudioLInk
1. Have a look at the example scene, "AudioLink_ExampleScene". It contains a lot of visual documentation of what is going on and includes several example setups. Or cut to the chase:

### Getting started
1. Drag AudioLink into scene
2. Link audio source by dragging the AudioSource gameobject into AudioLink's audio source parameter
3. Drag AudioLinkController into scene and drag AudioLink into the controller's "Audio Link" parameter.
4. Click the "Link all sound reactive objects..." button to link everything up.

### Installing to test Avatar projects
1. Import AudioLink into your avatar project
2. Drag AudioLinkAvatar prefab into scene with your avatar
3. Add your favorite music track to test with to your project
4. Drag your music track from the Project panel into the Hierarchy to create a new AudioSource GameObject
5. Drag the AudioSource object that was created in the Hierarchy into AudioLinkAvatar/audioSource parameter
6. Adjust the Gain/Bass/Treble settings on AudioLinkAvatar if necessary
7. Hit play!
