00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.040
In 1967, a postgraduate student at Cambridge
University by the name of Jocelyn Burnell

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.980
was surveying the sky with a newly constructed
radio telescope.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.760
After a few weeks she
discovered something odd.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.620
The telescope had picked up a radio signal
that seemed to be pulsating.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.360
The pulses had an interval
of exactly 1.33 seconds

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.020
and were initially thought to be
nothing more than man-made interference.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.320
However, it soon became clear the signal did
in fact emanate from deep space

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.640
and the unwavering precision of the pulses 
was unlike anything seen before.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.619
As such, many questioned whether it was a
naturally occurring phenomenon or a transmission

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.660
from another civilization.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.900
The radio source was even named LGM-1,
an acronym for little green men,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.040
and Burnell herself could not help but wonder
if she'd actually discovered

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.880
the first sign of life beyond the Earth.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.840
As you might expect, it didn't take long for
natural explanations to emerge

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.980
and we now know these pulsating signals 
to be produced by rapidly rotating neutron stars,

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.620
known as pulsars,

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.580
that emit beams of radiation akin
to the beams of light emitted by a lighthouse.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.300
If nothing else, it made for a neat album
cover.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.880
Ever since, an international effort known
as the search for extraterrestrial intelligence

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.880
has actively been listening for artificial
transmissions

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.100
but so far we appear to be the only ones 
broadcasting into the void.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.620
Humanity has been leaking radio signals into
space for the better part of a century

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.540
so any eavesdropping aliens within about 100
lightyears could potentially be alerted to our presence.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:09.880
Beyond this invisible radio bubble, enveloping some
15,000 stars, the Earth is just another silent speck.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.580
Not only that but as technology improves,
this radio leakage is dramatically reduced.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.620
Before long, Earth may return to a state of
radio silence.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.280
If most civilizations improve and eventually
outgrow radio technology at a similar pace,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.380
the radio signature of any one civilization
may only be detectable for a very brief period of time.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.020
Furthermore, this radio leakage is extremely
faint and only grows more and more diffused

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.120
as it expands into the galaxy.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.620
Some of the most powerful signals to leak
into space are military radar emissions

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.920
and stand a much better chance of detection
across interstellar distances

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.380
than the average television broadcast.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.250
The Square Kilometer Array, a vast interferometer
to be constructed in South Africa and Australia,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.129
could be sensitive enough to detect the faint
radio signature of an earthlike civilization

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.129
out to a distance of several hundred lightyears.

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.800
To detect more distant signals would require
more deliberate attempts at communication.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.320
For instance, advanced civilizations
may construct powerful beacons

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.920
specifically to increase their radio luminosity.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.100
These beacons would be rather expensive to maintain
as they would consume vasts amounts of energy

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.040
for extended periods of time.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.360
A less expensive alternative
would be a focused beam of radiation

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.220
as opposed to an
omnidirectional broadcast.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.200
In 1974, the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico
famously beamed an interstellar message

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.360
towards a globular cluster some
25,000 lightyears distant.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.660
The message took less than 3 minutes to transmit
so any prospecting aliens in the path of that signal

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.340
would have less than 3 minutes to detect it,
and they will never get a second chance.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.160
We may have been on the receiving end of such
an interstellar message when, in 1977,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.900
a momentary burst of energy
swept across the planet.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.560
Repeated attempts at redetection notwithstanding,
the famous Wow! Signal

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.840
was never detected again and its origin
has never been conclusively ascertained.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.440
On the slim chance
that it was of artificial origin

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.760
a reply was beamed in the
general direction whence it came in 2012.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.160
In a galaxy as old and vast as the Milky Way,
the probability of two civilizations

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.860
stumbling upon one another by briefly screaming
in random directions is not great.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.380
To increase our chances, we need to limit
our selection of targets by searching for other

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.600
technological and biological signatures.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.580
In 1995, the first extrasolar planet orbiting
a sunlike star was discovered.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.869
We now know the vast majority of the hundreds
of billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:51.960
are home to at least one planet.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.660
We also know that billions of those planets
are of similar size to the Earth

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.500
and orbit within the habitable zone
of a star similar to the Sun.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.460
This means that liquid water could exist on
the surface which is an essential ingredient

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.360
for life as we know it.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.740
Furthermore, billions of extrasolar moons
may also be capable of supporting life.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.300
With this knowledge in mind, in 2017, a message
was beamed towards one of the least distant

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.509
and most earthlike exoplanets
discovered to date.

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:23.559
The message comprised a number of musical
compositions and basic information about humankind

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.680
and should the planet be inhabited we could
expect a reply as early as 2044.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.900
Here's a quick preview of that future.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.520
However, habitability is no guarantee of habitation.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.180
To determine whether a potentially life-supporting
planet is currently supporting life

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.940
would require a more careful examination.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.820
For instance, by analyzing the starlight passing
though the atmosphere of an exoplanet,

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.760
it is possible to deduce its chemical composition.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.700
The spectrum of an oxygen-rich atmosphere will
differ from that of, say, a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:03.460
Given that photosynthetic plants and organisms are
responsible for the large quantities of oxygen on Earth,

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.200
an exoplanetary atmosphere with a similar 
concentration of oxygen could be taken as a sign of life.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.580
This is known as a biosignature.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.140
But it's far from definitive as oxygen could also
be the result of various abiogenic processes.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.740
As such, astrobiologists are more interested
in certain chemical combinations

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:28.760
as it would be far less likely for, say, methane and
carbon dioxide, to coexist in the absence of life.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.439
Speaking of carbon dioxide, some chemicals
could be indicative of industrial pollution

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.100
and thus artificially induced climate change
could serve as the universal sign of unintelligent life.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.560
In addition to biosignatures, we may be able
to detect signs of technology.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.280
For instance, an exoplanet surrounded by a dense
orbital belt of artificial satellites or space debris

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.300
could be detected during transit
of its parent star.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.000
This would be an example of a technosignature.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.860
A more extreme example
would be a megastructure.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:09.080
The initial speculation surrounding the discovery
of pulsars has become somewhat of a recurring theme.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.880
Whenever an astronomical discovery 
initially defies explanation,

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.080
vigorous speculation about aliens
take center stage.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.640
In more recent years, this discussion has been dominated by a peculiar star

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.000
some 1,500 lightyears distant.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.960
The star exhibit erratic light fluctuations
and occasionally dim by as much as 22%

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.820
and so one hypothesis is that an alien megastructure
is blocking the light from the star.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.420
While evidence of astroengineering is still
within the realm of possibility,

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.000
the dimming is now thought to be caused 
by nothing more than dust.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.940
The existence of circumstellar megastructures
was popularized by theoretical physicist

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.240
Freeman Dyson back in 1960
as a potential means for advanced civilizations

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.580
to harness the energy of their parent star.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.140
Commonly known as a
Dyson sphere or Dyson swarm.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.660
According to the Kardashev scale, a method
of measuring a civilization's energy consumption

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.360
proposed by astrophysicist
Nikolai Kardashev in 1964,

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.960
a Dyson sphere would be indicative
of a Type II civilization.

00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:14.599
A Type I civilization could harness the energy
of its home planet.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.340
A Type II civilization could harness the energy
of its parent star.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:24.000
A Type III civilization could harness the
total energy output of an entire galaxy.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.840
Extensive surveys of billions of stars notwithstanding,
there is no reliable evidence

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.280
of a Type II nor Type III civilization
in the Milky Way galaxy...

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.800
...so far.

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.700
What about extragalactic life?

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:46.360
After surveying 100,000 nearby galaxies for
signs of a Type III supercivilization,

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.260
astronomers found no signs
of a galactic empire.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.620
The great silence of the universe can be a
bit unnerving.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:16.240
Humanity is now on the verge of detecting
biosignatures on extrasolar planets

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.760
but Earth has been radiating
detectable biosignatures for billions of years,

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:26.580
yet, as far as we can tell, it's failed to attract
the attention of any alien astronomers.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:31.780
The apparent contradiction between the expectation
and lack of evidence for extraterrestrial life

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.240
is known as the Fermi Paradox.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.840
Given the sheer size and age of the universe,
why does it appear to be so lifeless?

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.540
It is possible to concoct
a myriad of hypothetical solutions.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:49.040
Perhaps life is common while intelligent life
is exceedingly rare.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.440
After all, it took some 4 billion years of
evolution and a number of mass extinctions

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.620
before humans emerged on Earth.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.980
Proponents of the rare Earth hypothesis suggest
that complex life on Earth

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:05.160
is the result of an improbable chain of events
unlikely to occur more than once.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:10.920
Perhaps there exists a barrier, either improbable
or impossible for life to overcome.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:15.240
If the barrier is behind us, we may be among
the fortunate few to have crossed it.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.020
Potential candidates include the emergence
of multicellular organisms

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.020
and the invention of nuclear weapons.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:27.620
If the barrier is still to come, we may soon join
the cosmological graveyard of fallen civilizations.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.700
Potential candidates include
unsustainable climate change

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.100
and the invention of nuclear weapons.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:38.320
Perhaps we severely underestimate how truly
alien aliens can be.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.700
All life on Earth is carbon-based and rely
on water but life could hypothetically be

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.540
silicon-based and thrive in
oceans of liquid ammonia.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.400
Just as we search for life as we know it,
aliens may be doing the same.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:57.860
Perhaps an advanced civilization did in fact
pay us a visit in the distant past.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:03.060
Unless some sort of evidence of that visitation
survived for millions or billions of years,

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.300
we'd never know.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:09.940
Even a visitation in the recent past could have been
misconstrued as gods descending from the heavens.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.000
Well, I mean, that would have been a fairly
accurate interpretation.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.520
Perhaps all civilizations inevitably develop
technology that transcend physical reality.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.440
For instance, reality could be rendered obsolete
by hyperrealistic simulations.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:30.880
By transferring ones consciousness into these virtual
wonderlands, one could achieve digital immortality.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:36.240
The happenstance offerings of nature would
struggle to compete with the promise of utopia.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.240
Throughout the galaxy, pockets of advanced civilizations
may occupy no more than a few star systems

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.100
as they explore inner space
in place of outer space.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:50.960
In his transcension hypothesis, futurist John Smart
takes it a step further and suppose this

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:56.980
introverted evolution will progressively miniaturize
computers until they are so intensely compressed

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.600
that they generate an environment
analogous to black holes.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:05.980
These postbiological civilizations would thus
transcend the spacetime continuum

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.580
and vanish from the visible universe.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.900
Hypothetically speaking.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.680
Apart from artificial transmissions and distant
signs of astroengineering,

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.780
there's also a far less remote
form of technosignature.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:29.980
The Voyager spacecraft was launched in 1977
and, as of the making of this video,

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.120
it is the only probe to have
reached interstellar space.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.100
It famously carries a golden record
with information about mankind

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:42.240
but it will take another 40,000 years
before the probe encounters another star.

00:12:42.249 --> 00:12:46.959
In an effort to more expeditiously explore
the galaxy, an advanced civilization may launch

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.440
sophisticated interstellar probes capable
of self-replication.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.600
These probes would be intelligent enough to
mine the available resources

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.700
in any given planetary system
to create copies of themselves.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:04.160
These copies would then travel to neighboring
systems and create additional copies.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.640
If these probes could travel at just
10% of the speed of light,

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.600
a speed attainable by modern methods of propulsion,

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:16.200
every corner of the galaxy could be
exhaustively explored in just a few million years.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.540
A relatively short amount of time
on cosmological timescales.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:26.540
Mankind is now fast approaching the technological
sophistication to launch such a probe.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.240
This begs the question...

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.880
Why is the Solar System so probeless?

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.380
If human progress is any indication, the galaxy
should be completely overrun

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:40.360
by self-replicating automata,
yet we see no evidence of that.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:47.340
An ongoing hunt for alien artifacts has yet to locate
any covert probes lurking in the Solar System

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.399
but space is vast.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:54.340
An object of extrasolar origin could easily
be zipping around our cosmic backyard

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:55.740
without our knowledge.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.860
In fact, that is exactly
what happened in 2017.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:04.640
An extrasolar object, named 'Oumuamua, passed
through the inner Solar System

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.200
and went completely unnoticed until it was 
moving away from the Sun.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:14.140
Even then, its discovery was pure luck and
thousands of extrasolar visitors

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.200
could go undetected each year.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:21.400
The size and shape of 'Oumuamua can only be
inferred by the amount of light it reflects

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.640
but it appears to be highly elongated
or extremely flat.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.320
Initially, it was thought to be a comet but
the absence of a cometary coma,

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.580
a trailing cloud of dust and gas
typically formed when comets approach the Sun,

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.200
lent credence to it being an asteroid.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.320
But then the object began to accelerate.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:47.089
This acceleration would be consistent with
the outgassing of a comet but, as mentioned,

00:14:47.089 --> 00:14:51.300
'Oumuamua does display the expected characteristics
of a comet.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:58.700
One possibility is that this outgassing is simply too faint
for us to detect but there is that remote possibility

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.240
of it being an interstellar probe.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:06.220
More specifically, a probe using a light sail
as a means of propulsion.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:11.140
On the other hand, 'Oumuamua is perfectly
radio silent.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:17.700
Perhaps it's a defunct probe, destined to
aimlessly roam the galaxy, much like Voyager.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:29.520
It's important to remember that
with a sample-size of one, that being Earth,

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.260
we cannot possibly know how
common or rare life truly is.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:40.480
There could be hundreds of planets or millions
of galaxies between us and them.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:45.580
If life was discovered elsewhere in the Solar System,
perhaps beneath the frozen mantle of Europa,

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.740
we'd be able to compare and contrast
two distinct sources of life

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.660
and gain crucial insight
into its commonality or rarity.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.520
Many reject the anthropocentric view of Earth
as a cosmological oddity

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:02.340
due to the sheer number of earthlike planets
coupled with the resilience of life on Earth

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.900
but the truth is, we don't know.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:10.720
We don't know if billions of planets is sufficient
for intelligence to arise more than once.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:16.380
We don't know the prerequisites for abiogenesis,
the transition from non-life to life.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:20.240
We don't know the probability of cosmic solitude.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:26.360
But to conclude that we are alone in the face
of all this ignorance is more than a bit presumptions.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.569
The extent of our search for extraterrestrial
intelligence has been compared to searching

00:16:30.569 --> 00:16:34.160
a glass of water for evidence of fish in all
of Earth's oceans.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.740
Space is unimaginably vast and we have barely
begun to scratch the surface.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:44.600
There are so many untapped avenues for detecting
signs of life that if we just turned that telescope

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:50.260
a bit to the left, made it a bit larger, and listened
to a slightly different range of frequencies

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.200
perhaps the universe wouldn't be so silent.
