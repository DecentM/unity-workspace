1 14500 After five years of searching, I have finally found...
2 17800 
1 18720 ...something.
2 19880 
1 27460 Back in 2014,˟I received an email with a link to an article.
1 30980 The article was titled˟"Solve the Mystery of the Pointy S"
1 33960 and was about this stylized symbol˟in the shape of the letter S.
1 37780 Upon seeing the symbol,˟a dormant cluster of neurons and synapses
1 41420 within the deepest recesses of˟my brain lit up like a Christmas tree,
1 45140 and forced a long-forgotten˟memory to the surface.
1 48220 I used to draw this symbol˟back in primary school.
1 50980 Two rows of three vertical lines connected˟by four diagonal lines in the middle.
1 55260 The ends were then capped, like so,˟to create an S-shaped symbol.
1 59380 Beyond that,˟I could not remember where it came from,
1 61400 what it was supposed to represent,˟nor if it ever had a name.
1 65040 I think it was just a cool symbol˟that me and my classmates used to draw.
1 68680 To my surprise, however, this wasn't just some˟localized fad but a globally recognized symbol.
1 74760 People from all over the world reported they too had˟learned to draw this symbol as children or teenagers.
1 80320 None of whom seemed to know where it came from.
1 82800 After reading about this,˟I showed the symbol to my friends and family
1 86120 to see if I could provoke a few more Christmas trees˟and, sure enough,
1 89400 every single one of them recognized the symbol.
1 92120 Unfortunately, they were just as clueless as I was˟when it came to its origin.
1 96320 At this point, I was hooked.
1 98440 This is exactly the type of inconsequential˟good-for-nothing mysteries
1 102160 that make me want to wake up in the morning.
1 104180 But as I began my search,˟I soon realized I was far from the first
1 107320 to attempt to track down˟the origins of this symbol.
1 109980 Many had tried and failed where I now stood.
1 113280 But in my delusions of grandeur, I brushed it off as the˟failings of lesser men, and into the abyss I went.
1 119720 I turned to my trusty board of keys,˟making sure to enable investigation mode,
1 123840 and after some intense clickety-clang,
1 125440 I managed to track down˟over 40 online discussions about this symbol.
1 129240 From this, I quickly learned the symbol was strongly˟associated with the American clothing brand Stüssy.
1 134520 So much so that many even˟refer to the symbol as a Stüssy.
1 138040 Stüssy was founded in the early 1980s, and many insist˟they remember this symbol being one of their logos.
1 144400 The problem is, there is no evidence of that.
1 147200 Countless attempts notwithstanding,
1 148860 no one has been able to produce an article of˟Stüssy clothing featuring this exact design
1 153320 or even just a photograph˟of someone wearing such an article.
1 157160 Although, to be fair, some designs,˟like these two, are quite similar,
1 161640 and it's not difficult to see˟why people would conflate one for the other.
1 165680 Now, this could have been the end of the story˟if it wasn't for the fact
1 169280 that many claims to have drawn this symbol˟long before the 1980s.
1 173000 I mean, it's not like people would just go on the˟internet and lie, but even a spokesperson for Stüssy
1 177400 claims the symbol predates the˟founding of the company.
1 180580 And so, I returned to my alphabet shovel˟and resumed digging.
1 184220 Another frequent association is with the Japanese˟car and motorcycle company Suzuki.
1 188720 While that emblem has the same basic shape,˟the differences are also quite pronounced.
1 194010 The two most obvious ones being the spacing˟between the strokes of the letter,
1 197940 as well as the complete lack of vertical lines.
1 200800 However, the Suzuki logo˟has been in use since 1958,
1 205220 and so it has the advantage of being old enough˟to possibly be the origin.
1 209520 As such, one could argue that this is merely˟a simplified version which developed over time
1 215980 because it's easier to draw.
1 218300 Even so, I struggled to reconcile the fact that ˟school children all over the world
1 223040 would want to reproduce the emblem˟of a Japanese motor company.
1 226660 At least the Stüssy explanation made sense˟as it is a clothing brand
1 229760 specifically targeting that demographic.
1 232460 And so, I spun up the ol'˟dexterity trampoline once more.
1 235600 Another popular theory is that the symbol˟originated as a logo used by a rock or metal band.
1 240700 For instance, the symbol is frequently associated˟with the American heavy mental band Slipknot
1 245220 but there's not even a passing resemblance˟in that case.
1 248160 Other bands include Styx, Slayer, and KISS,˟just to name a few.
1 252560 The only band I've come across which actually˟does use the symbol as part of their logo
1 256380 is the American thrash metal band, Sacred Reich.
1 259360 Unfortunately, the band was founded in 1985,˟and so it's not a contender for the origin.
1 265440 I could go on and on about all of these dead ends,˟but in the end, they're all just dead ends.
1 271380 So after spending a whole lot of time˟on a whole lot of nothing,
1 274440 I decided to do something productive.
1 276700 I needed a way to gauge˟the prevalence of this symbol,
1 279740 and so I spent some time extracting all the comments˟from all of these online discussions
1 284360 until I had a list˟of more than 27,000 comments
1 287700 I then sifted through this˟wretched hive of scum and villainy
1 290800 to extract all the comments that mentioned˟a country, demonym, or capital city.
1 295320 After filtering out all the false positives,˟I ended up with a list of 1,215 comments
1 300800 which mentioned a country˟where this symbol had been seen or drawn.
1 304580 When mapped out geographically,˟this is what that data looks like.
2 308500 
1 331760 Alright, let's dial it back with the theatrics.
1 334040 As you can see,˟this symbol is practically universal.
1 338320 There is naturally going to be an overrepresentation of˟English-speaking countries like the US, UK, and Australia
1 344540 as these comments were taken˟from websites dominated by those countries.
1 348140 But it's still interesting to note that the˟symbol has a presence on every continent.
1 352400 Well, except Antarctica.
1 354420 As far as we know.
1 356120 I then went through the same process, except this time,˟I extracted all the comments that mentioned a date.
1 361520 This is what that looks like.
1 363300 If these users on the internet, which is a˟sacred place of truth and nothing but the truth,
1 367600 then sightings of this symbol˟may go all the way back to the 1940s.
1 372160 It's not just international˟but an intergenerational symbol.
1 376500 An S that transcends both space and time.
1 380240 It's The Universal S!
2 382140 
1 382720 Speaking of which, is this even an S?
1 385720 Because some claim they always˟recognized the symbol as the number 8.
1 390040 Which, when you think about it,˟makes perfect sense.
1 392780 It could also depict the number 5˟or the number 2 when horizontally inverted,
1 397040 as seen in this graffiti from 2006.
1 399680 And why limit ourselves to just alphanumerics?
1 402020 It could also be a depiction of an infinity˟symbol, a dollar sign, or a double helix.
1 406800 Some speculate it could be˟a simplistic rendition of an ouroboros,
1 410340 which is an ancient symbol of a snake or dragon eating˟its own tail to represent the circle of life and death.
1 416320 While it is tempting˟to think it could be a Möbius strip,
1 419500 this is not the case˟as a Möbius strip famously has one side
1 423080 while this symbol clearly has two.
1 425620 To further complicate the situation,˟there are way too many names for this symbol.
1 430740 One frequent name is the Superman S,˟presumably in reference to the iconic S of Superman,
1 436120 despite the lack of similarity between the two.
1 438480 Others have opted for more generic prefixes˟like Skater-, Surfer-, Stoner-, Cool-, and Gangster-.
1 444780 In total, I've come across over 60 different˟names which make researching this symbol
1 449580 an absolute blast.
1 451580 I also noticed a tendency for people to combine˟the symbol with certain terms and phrases.
1 456380 For example, it's frequently drawn˟as part of the word smile,
1 459680 specifically with a palm tree˟in place of the letter L.
1 462980 This is especially common in Greece˟for some reason.
1 466660 As if that wasn't enough, quite a few people claim˟to have drawn a chain-, rope-, or braid-like pattern
1 473180 by continuously adding rows of three vertical lines˟before closing off the ends, like so.
1 479000 What this means is The Universal S may have˟originated as a pattern
1 483220 that was eventually truncated down˟to an S-shaped symbol.
1 487000 If that's the case, this pattern could have˟existed for many centuries, if not millennia,
1 491720 because humans kinda have a thing for symmetry.
1 494660 Every culture on Earth has,˟at one point or another,
1 497220 made use of tessellation,˟interlacing, and decorative knotwork.
1 501740 So, with that in mind, I spent an ungodly˟amount of time looking at
1 505440 ornamental books, ancient artifacts,˟and medieval thingamajigs,
1 509520 yet I have been utterly defeated in my quest˟to find evidence of this exact pattern.
1 514700 Some were indeed similar and might have inspired˟this pattern, but I could not find an exact match.
1 521720 Suffice it to say; things were going great!
2 524100 
1 524960 In the midst of this˟action-packed adventure of indiscovery,
1 527900 I happened upon this comment˟posted by a user on Reddit back in 2011.
1 532890 According to them,˟The Universal S began as a puzzle.
1 536580 The puzzle consisted of˟two rows of three vertical lines
1 539500 and the challenge was to turn those lines into an S˟using nothing but straight lines.
1 544620 This sounded quite promising, and so I˟contacted said user and received this response.
1 549100 The puzzle was more specifically˟a matchstick puzzle
1 552160 and it had supposedly been featured˟in a magazine titled Dynamite
1 555740 published by˟the American publisher Scholastic.
1 558400 Unfortunately,˟the first issue was published in 1974,
1 562060 so even if this puzzle existed,˟it could not be the origin.
1 565580 However, I decided to pursue this lead anyway˟because if I could find it,
1 569520 at least I would have some tangible evidence˟of the symbol's existence.
1 573400 Keep in mind, up until this point,˟all I had was hearsay.
1 577200 A bunch of internet strangers,˟the most veracious group to ever walk this Earth,
1 581180 claiming they had seen or drawn this symbol˟at various points in time.
1 584920 The oldest photographic evidence came in the˟form of this aforementioned graffiti from 2006,
1 590000 as well as this squiggly version of the symbol˟etched into a desk from a Danish prison
1 594660 that closed down in 2006.
1 597200 I... I don't even remember how I found that.
1 599860 Anyway, I've since acquired about˟a dozen issues of Dynamite magazine
1 603720 as well as a bunch of matchstick puzzle books,˟and this would turn out to be a massive break...
2 608860 
1 609640 ...of my spirit.
1 611180 Not a single one of these issues˟feature a matchstick puzzle of any kind.
1 616160 It's not even featured˟in the German masterpiece Streichholzspiele,
1 620120 which is said to be˟the mother of all matchstick puzzle books.
1 623140 And despite near endless repository˟of matchstick puzzles available online,
1 627260 including every single puzzle˟featured in these books,
1 630340 this one is curiously missing.
2 633120 
1 633940 After spending so much time on this˟and getting absolutely nowhere
1 637160 I reluctantly put this topic aside˟and moved on to other projects.
2 641620 
1 646640 For April Fools of 2017,˟Reddit orchestrated this event called Place.
1 652200 It was essentially a blank canvas˟divided into a million pixels,
1 656120 and each user was allowed to alter the color˟of one pixel every couple of minutes.
1 660600 Whole communities came together and painted˟anything and everything, one pixel at a time.
1 665700 And as my eyes marveled at this pixelated˟microcosm of human civilization,
1 669960 something caught my attention.
2 672000 
1 672560 In the corner, there it was.
1 675260 In this rainbow-colored soup of insanity,˟some loose-knit band of heroes
1 679820 had joined forces to construct a symbol˟of which they knew nothing about.
1 683960 The gods had clearly spoken.
1 686170 The search had to continue.
2 688080 
1 688980 And, this time, it was different because,˟this time, I found something.
1 694020 Throughout the video, I've alluded to another˟potential origin.
1 697280 Namely, graffiti.
1 698680 Many believe the symbol originated within˟the American graffiti movement of the '60s and '70s
1 703440 and claim that various street gangs,˟especially on the East- and West coast,
1 707140 used The Universal S as their tag.
1 709740 It makes a lot of sense because˟graffiti makes heavy use of outlined block letters
1 713900 and drawing a symmetrical S in that style˟can be quite frustrating.
1 718140 Perhaps, this frustration is what gave birth˟to the comparatively simplistic technique
1 722830 we use to draw The Universal S.
1 724880 Two rows of three vertical lines˟connected by some lines in the middle.
1 728300 Simple.
1 729180 I can't even remember how many˟tens of thousands of photographs of graffiti
1 733160 I must have sifted through over the years,
1 735200 but one day I found this.
1 738000 It's an art piece by an artist named˟Jean-Michel Basquiat,
1 741680 and it was painted in New York in 1982.
1 744880 I almost missed it but in the corner,˟just as the pixel gods had promised, there it was.
1 750860 Basquiat describes it as the "CLASSIC S OF GRAFF",˟graff being short for graffiti,
1 755780 and it's not his only piece˟to feature the symbol.
2 758860 
1 764760 Interestingly enough, here it's painted right next˟to what appears to be the Superman symbol.
1 769580 Now, I knew this was not the origin,˟but it was some much-needed evidence
1 773760 to substantiate this ocean of hearsay.
1 776510 Furthermore, it gave me some˟much-needed motivation to keep digging
1 779580 because I had all but given up at this point.
1 782040 And with this newfound motivation I stumbled˟upon something totally unexpected.
1 786880 I was reading about this photographer˟named Jon Naar who, in 1974,
1 791840 had published an influential photobook about graffiti˟titled The Faith of Graffiti.
1 797660 For some reason,˟the name Jon Naar sounded familiar,
1 801020 and after retracing my research,˟I managed to figure out why.
1 804780 Years before, I had watched an interview with˟Jon Naar conducted by none other than Stüssy.
1 810500 I don't think I paid˟much attention to the video back then
1 813120 but I really wish I had because˟1 minute and 38 seconds into that video,
1 818480 one of the photographs from The Faith of Graffiti˟is prominently displayed on screen.
1 823240 And hidden amongst the graffiti˟in that photograph is The Universal S.
2 827300 
1 828560 The photograph was taken in˟New York City in late 1973
1 833140 and it's not the only photograph in this collection˟in which the symbol is featured.
1 837400 What was so unexpected˟about this discovery
1 839960 is the fact that the symbol˟was literally hiding in plain sight.
1 844140 Not only was the interview conducted by the˟brand most strongly associated with this symbol,
1 849200 the video was uploaded in 2010˟and has since amassed over 25,000 views.
1 855510 In spite of this,˟it seems to have gone completely undetected.
1 859280 Nevertheless, these photographs were now the˟earliest known evidence of The Universal S.
1 864370 After spending a few more weeks˟chasing down potential leads without success
1 868440 I put the video back on the shelf once again˟and went to work on other videos.
2 872820 
1 873440 Fast forward to mid 2018˟when someone else discovered
1 877160 that in the movie Piranha from 1978,
1 880220 the symbol can be seen scribbled onto the wall˟of a jail cell about two-thirds into the movie.
1 885820 I found out the scene˟was filmed in Los Angeles the same year
1 888760 and while it did not predate˟the aforementioned photographs,
1 891640 it was still more evidence.
2 893340 
1 894140 Sometime thereafter, I stumbled upon another˟collection of photographs taken in Los Angeles
1 898860 in the early 1970s˟by photographer Howard Gribble.
1 902660 Many of which feature the number 8˟in a style reminiscent of the The Universal S.
1 908260 The least ambiguous of which˟is definitely this one.
1 911920 Given that the symbol in this photograph is˟slightly faded compared to the text underneath,
1 916520 which appears to have been written in 1970,˟it might have been painted in the late 1960s.
1 922660 This was now the earliest known evidence.
1 925640 Although, as I later discovered,˟I am not the first to find this.
1 929140 A Reddit user by the name of GaryDuder posted˟a comment with a link to this photograph back in 2013.
1 935360 Unfortunately, it was buried beneath˟a mountain of other comments,
1 938840 and so this quite significant piece of evidence˟fell by the wayside.
2 942840 
1 943640 In any case, I was fairly satisfied at this point.
1 947140 I may not have found the origin, but I had˟found irrefutable evidence of the symbol's existence,
1 952600 and that was a hell of a lot more˟than I had at the beginning of all of this.
1 956010 So a couple of months ago,˟I began writing the initial draft for this script.
1 961300 In doing so, I found myself going through˟my research for the quadrillionth time
1 966360 just to make sure I had˟exhausted every conceivable avenue.
1 970500 That's when I stumbled upon this illustration˟featured in a book titled Mechanical Graphics.
1 978600 This book˟is not from the '60s, nor '50s, nor the 1940s.
1 984220 It's not even from the 1900s.
1 987380 This book was published in 1890.
1 991580 What's so wonderful about this book is that˟it was written by a professor named Frederick Willson
1 997280 who taught geometry˟at Princeton University in New Jersey.
1 1001560 So, perhaps, just maybe,˟this is the school where it all began.
1 1007100 As an expert on˟descriptive geometry and technical drawing,
1 1010820 Willson might have taught his students˟this neat trick of how to draw a symmetrical S.
1 1018160 I suppose we may never know.
1 1020060 Regardless, the existence of this illustration˟makes The Universal S well over a century old.
1 1026220 Presuming, of course,˟that you accept this slightly rounded version
1 1029700 as a distant ancestor˟of the more angular version we see today.
1 1033800 While it may seem strange for a symbol like this˟to be globally recognized long before the internet,
1 1038740 it's really not.
1 1039920 There are numerous pre-internet symbols˟with unknown origins
1 1043100 which have as much of a global reach˟as The Universal S.
1 1046420 The Sator Square and Kilroy˟are but two examples.
1 1049820 If anything, this symbol exemplifies the phenomenon˟for which Richard Dawkins coined the term meme
1 1055300 back in 1976.
1 1057240 An idea or behavior˟transmitted from person to person.
1 1061300 In this case,˟through writing and word-of-mouth.
1 1064100 Nor is it difficult to see why it spread as˟the method by which this symbol is drawn
1 1068500 is both clever and practical.
1 1070790 A perfect recipe for virality.
1 1072940 No, the mystery here is all about the origin.
1 1076600 Where did it come from?
1 1078220 Does it really stem from some generic pattern,˟or could this 19th-century illustration
1 1084480 truly be the beginning?
1 1086500 For all we know,˟this symbol may date back to the dawn of mankind,
1 1090980 plastered across the walls of paleolithic caves˟just waiting to be discovered.
1 1096580 Okay, that may be a bit of a reach but...
1 1099260 All I know is that I certainly won't be the˟one to definitively solve the mystery of the pointy S
1 1104760 because with the conclusion of this˟godforsaken video I am so @#%!& done with this topic.
1 1110840 Thanks for watching, bye.
