1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:03,203
[school bell ringing]

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:06,940
All right class, settle down—and 
Takanashi, will you stop looking out

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,442
the window again as if you're some main 
character?

4
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:10,710
That means you too, Pikachu.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,078
Pikachu!

6
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:12,879
[music]

7
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:15,448
I possess the Eye of the Wicked Lord!

8
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:16,750
Rikka Takanashi!

9
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,486
Reality rejected, be banished
from this world!

10
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:21,454
Yeah, you get the gist.

11
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:25,091
Operation: "Get Senpai to Notice Me"
starts now!

12
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:25,091
[PHIA]: Do you want to know about
the Ugandan Knuckles?

13
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,262
[AYAME]: Then you pretend you like
his interests!

14
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,864
And boom! Love at first sight.

16
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,864
You've come to the right place!

17
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:39,839
[RIKKA]: There's one little bitty issue.
It's through the forbidden portals.

18
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,376
Okay, we tried.

19
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:48,982
After excruciating hours of research,
I've concluded

20
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:52,385
you have ventured through the forbidden
portals and returned safely.

21
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,520
Is that correct?

22
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,222
Oh, I see what this is.

23
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,224
Luffy! Was this your doing?

24
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,692
The good old orphan joke, huh?

25
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,294
That's why you're gonna be the
King of Pirates one day.

26
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:02,162
Keep it up.
- [RIKKA]: Hey!

27
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,930
I'm not an orphan or a joke.

28
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,398
Alright, then where are your parents?

29
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,734
Um... Overseas business trip?

30
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,069
That happens a lot around here.

31
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,471
What a bunch of irresponsible parents.

32
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,073
Okay, look. I'll give you this.

33
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,242
[dramatic music]

34
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,678
[RIKKA]: Um, what's it like?

35
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,181
Kid, you have no idea.

36
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,317
[ROSHI]: You planning on coming back
this time?

37
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:29,155
Know your place, Takanashi. You will 
never, ever be good enough for Deku.

38
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,925
[RIKKA]: So, what exactly is the plan here

39
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,828
Take portals to different worlds until 
we find a Knuckles?

40
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,896
Yeah, something like that.

41
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:43,536
What's the PC Quest?
- I don't know.

42
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:49,642
[RIKKA]: It helped a bit, you know...
to pretend I was someone else.

43
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:50,777
At least for a little while.

44
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,846
[KAKASHI]: This universe has
no boundaries.

45
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,581
Be whatever you want to be.

46
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,116
You don't need to pretend.

47
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,219
Just don't go flying around 
or you'll get us both banned.

48
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,188
[music]

49
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,638
[Titan roars]

50
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,172
[metal clanging]

51
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:30,783
Wow, such a pretty mirror.
- Wow, what a pretty mirror...

52
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,321
Heheheh... Don't cry, it's only your leg.
- [POOH]: First time?

53
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,289
Heheheh... Don't cry, it's only your leg.
- [KAKASHI]: Uh... Yeah...

54
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,824
- [RIKKA]: He's just hungry.
- [KAKASHI] Uh... Yeah...

55
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,193
- [RIKKA]: Good Knuckles. So ungrateful,
Midoriya.
- [POOH]: Mirror dwelling can get

56
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,528
- [RIKKA]: Good Knuckles. So ungrateful,
Midoriya.
- [POOH]: the best of us.
